SLACK OVERFLOW
 
## Heading ##
Join the Slack Overflow Community!

## Sub-Heading ##
 For those who wants the personalized benefits of slack and the simplicity stack overflow. 

## Summary ##
  Slack Overflow brings together programmers of all coding backgrounds from around the world to discuss, ask, and answer code. It combines the fundamental features of Stack Overflow and the instant direct messaging  system of Slack to bring you the best of both worlds.

## Problem ##
  When you use Stack Overflow, you can see questions related to all fields. This generic kind of implementation can be both confusing and itimidating to someone who is just starting out, or who might only want to see specific fields. 

## Solution ##
  Slack Overflow solves this by only showing you the fields you want, and allowing you to specify a field when you ask a question. If you are not satisfied with your answer, you can choose not to add reputation to the answer, or message the person if you have a problem or just to discuss code.

## Quote from You ##
